Create A model for the news papers and upload your first news paper.
- Things to consider:
    How to I specicfy that I want Newspaper documents in the GrossePointeNews collection to go in the Newspaper collection under the Local History Archives collection?
    See tree in MongoDB

    Is it possible to put a pdf in a request or will it need to be hosted somewhere else?


^Resolution: Since the PDF files are already hosted on the webserver, you only need to add the url to the pdf as part of the document data.
    Secondly, the collection is specified as the third argument in the model creation.

GP news route has the needed functionalities for incoming requests: POST(create), GET (read), PUT(update), DELETE(delete) [CRUD]
Need to build these functionalities for the other outlets.

Do I specify where documents go in the model? Or do I have to instantiate multiple DB connections? Probably the former. Research needed.
